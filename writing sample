You just gotta flow with life man   Sometimes the banger esoteric secrets are flowing and sometimes they aren’t, just gotta sit with the space and allow it all to be as it is, all has its time, 
and it’s just about remaining present throughout   Chop wood, carry water, and allow the logos to speak through you when it wills to do as such   I am but a channel for that which is beyond me, same as you,
it’s just a matter of if you recognize it, you are a pawn of the divine just as anyone else is, even if you don’t see it, God is working through you to impact the lives others in every moment, whether to trigger
healing, to take part in the healing or to bask in the healed space and be grateful for it   As we all cross paths, we all exchange karma, fulfilling soul contracts, starting up new ones, and letting old ones be
torn up  We are all the divine mind working towards a goal in a vast number of individual forms. You have access to this mind, and you can see how God is working through you, it’s just a matter of turning your
awareness inwards, and allowing the light to come forth from the darkness to speak to you   Being open, and allowing the space for divinity to work in your life and bring about the highest good in all scenarios,
allows for the greatest healing at all times and places between all individuals, it just depends on your openness to be as such  The more open you are, the more miracles God has the space to put in your life,
and the more space you have to be a miracle in the lives of others   And in a somewhat self fulfilling manner, I didn’t really have anything to say, hence, the opening of this,yet that allowed the space for this to flow through  
Be joyful, be grateful and just be happy to be here above all else, in that you cultivate a space for the divine to work through you to bring the highest good about in every and all scenario   I am you
